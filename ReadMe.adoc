= Project: Drone Release Light Sensor

This code is used to open a servo when it detects light from your drone. Connectd everything as shown in step 2.
U can use an Arduino Uno or Nano and the code would be the same. 

== Step 1: Installation

1. Open this file
2. Go to the Arduino Web editor to upload the code on your Arduino


== Step 2: Assemble the circuit
image::Owl_Arduino_Drone_Routing.JPG[]


== Step 3: Load the code

Upload the code contained in this sketch on to your board

In the code you will see that the lightvalue is set for >900 that means when it detects a lot of light (flashlight on the sensor) it will open the Servo. If you want to open the servo by less light look in the Monitor what number it gives by the preffered light and set the number on that value.
